# Touch-Screen-based-fully-Digital-Instrument-cluster-Using-Raspberry-Pi-,CPP-and-QT-QML
This is a freelance project developed by me when i got a chance to work with a very early startup as a freelancer. Those guys were developing a two wheeler electric sports bike and wanted someone to build a fully digital instrument cluster! This is a fully Digital touch screen based vehicle instrument cluster. Features of the cluster involves a circular gauge based design, Turn indicators, fuel meter, RPM meter and engine temperature. The project is not yet completed and still tons of things are left to be added, bugs fixed and calibrated. I'll keep updating as i keep adding new things to it. I used a Raspberry Pi 3, 4-inch Touch screen panel, QT Creator and C++. I'll explain everything, right from the start! There are 3 major steps in this project:-
                                        1) Installing raspbian and add support for Touch screen
                                        2) Cross compiling QT for Raspberry pi 3
                                        3) Building and deploying the actual app onto Pi 3
